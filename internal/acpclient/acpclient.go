// Package acpclient is the seam the TUI holds the agent side by (spec C2).
//
// The TUI reaches the agent side only through the two interfaces below: Host
// for the transport, Session for one conversation. Reads are synchronous and
// every call takes a context, so a caller never waits on a promise and an
// implementation never has to buffer for one.
//
// Each method's doc ends with an "ACP:" line naming the ACP method that
// carries it, or "ACP: none" when the method is a property of the transport.
// Methods carries the same mapping as data, so the seam can be checked against
// acp.Server without reading the docs.
//
// The TUI may import this package and acpwire, never inproc: the in-process
// adapter is an implementation, and the wire types are the only values that
// cross. The interfaces gain their groups' methods plan by plan (spec
// Migration order); a method added here needs a row in Methods and an ACP:
// line in its doc.
